# VidTok - TikTok Clone

A high-performance TikTok-like video sharing app built with React Native, Expo, and Firebase. This project focuses heavily on video performance optimization and memory management to deliver a smooth, responsive user experience.

## 🚀 Features

- **Video Recording & Playback** - High-quality video recording with real-time preview
- **Social Features** - Like, share and interact with videos
- **Authentication** - Google OAuth and email/password authentication
- **Cloud Storage** - Secure video uploads to Cloudinary
- **Real-time Database** - Firebase Firestore for data persistence
- **Responsive Design** - Optimized for both portrait and landscape videos
- **Performance Optimized** - Advanced memory management and video preloading

## 🎯 Performance Focus

Performance is crucial for video apps, and this project implements several advanced optimizations:

### Video Performance Optimizations

**1. Multiple Video Format Support**
- Tested and optimized for various video types and aspect ratios
- Smart content fitting to prevent content cropping
- Dynamic aspect ratio calculation for mixed video formats

**2. Landscape to Portrait Conversion**
- Implemented intelligent video scaling to convert landscape videos to portrait
- Preserves full content without cutting off important parts
- Uses `contentFit` strategies: `contain` for landscape, `cover` for portrait

**3. Memory Leak Prevention**
- **Limited Memory Usage**: Only 2-3 videos kept in memory at any time
- **Smart Cleanup**: Automatic player cleanup when components unmount
- **FlatList Optimization**: `removeClippedSubviews`, `maxToRenderPerBatch`, `windowSize`
- **React.memo**: Prevents unnecessary re-renders of off-screen videos

**4. Video Preloading**
- Next video preloads muted and paused
- Eliminates black frame delays during scrolling
- Smooth TikTok-like transitions between videos

**5. Player Lifecycle Management**
- Proper event listener cleanup
- Safe player pause with error handling
- Status change monitoring for optimal playback timing

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React Native, Expo, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS via Nativewind
